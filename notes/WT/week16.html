<h6>WT Week 16</h6>

<h1>Internet of Things (IoT)</h1>

<p><strong>tldr</strong> - Bunch of buzzwords</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The general idea of things that are readable, recognisable, locatable, addressable and controllable via the Internet</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Everyday objects includes not only electronic devices but also such as food and clothing</li>
</ul>

<h2>IoT Technology Trends</h2>

<h3>Miniaturisation of Devices</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>As IoT uses technologies to connect physical objects to the internet, the size and cost of electronic components have to be small.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Semiconductor industry is doubling transistor density every 2 years ∴ allowing for smaller devices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advances in RFID Technologies</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>RFID could provide streams of data that supplies information systems with real-time, item-specific data.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>RFID tags are flexible enough to be placed in extremely small spaces and locations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>IPv6 can provide trillions of unique IPv6 addresses.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Roughly 50 billion connected devices</li>
	<li>IPv6 can potentially be used to address all these devices</li>
	<li>Promotes end-to-end connectivity and control</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvement in Communication Throughput and Latency</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Slide has too much crap so here’s the Ivan-style tldr - Improvements in technology improves communication throughput and latency</li>
</ul>

<h3>Real Time Analytics</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>IoT creates opportunities for real-time analytics</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Allows large volumes of data to be stored for analysis at a later time</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adoption of Cloud Technology</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Cloud computing makes things much better by relying on the internet :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Security</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>With the distributed nature of IoT devices in public areas, security is a big concern.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Wireless sensor network connecting sensors and IoT devices often not well protected

		<ul>
			<li>Encryption techniques can be used to improve security</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Protection on IoT devices such as web cam is quite weak

		<ul>
			<li>e.g. Default passwords are used</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>IoT Wireless Communication Issues</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Huge volume of sensors with varied types and distributed sites need to be connected, managed and maintained</li>
	<li>Environments with lots of interference requires highly reliable communication</li>
	<li>Limited spectrum resources available for new IoT wireless network</li>
	<li>Outdoors environment

		<ul>
			<li>Requires low power consumption and simple architecture</li>
			<li>Installation and maintenance more challenging</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
