<p><strong>tldr</strong> - MAC methods for IEEE 802.11 networks, MAC frame formats &amp; MAC layer operations</p>

<h2>MAC Methods for Ethernet Network (Recap)</h2>

<h3>CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>A data link layer protocol defining the access control method for IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) networks</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Before transmission, a station listens</li>
	<li>During transmission, the station should continue to listen</li>
	<li>When a collision is detected, each station should stop transmission, send a “jammed” signal and re-transmit after a random interval</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Problem with CSMA/CD in Wireless Networks</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Cannot be used for WLAN as collisions are hard to detect</li>
	<li>CSMA/CD requires stations to be able to transmit and receive at the same time</li>
	<li>However, in radio systems, the transmitted signal has more power than the received signal</li>
	<li>The signal from a transmitting station will overpower its own ability to receive a transmission</li>
	<li>This means a transmitting station “drowns out” its own ability to detect a collision</li>
	<li>∴ CSMA/CD cannot be used for IEEE 802.11 networks</li>
</ul>

<h2>MAC Methods for IEEE 802.11 Networks</h2>

<h3>Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)</h3>

<p>a.k.a. CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)</p

<ul>
	<li>Mandatory</li>
	<li>Contention-based</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>After a station has successfully transmitted a frame, all stations wait a random time for medium to clear before starting the next transmission</li>
	<li>For IEEE 802.11b, each time slot is 20 microseconds</li>
	<li>So, if a client’s random back-off period is 3 time slots, it has to wait for 60 ms before attempting to transmit</li>
	<li>∴ reducing chances of a collision occurring</li>
	<li>With radio-based LANs, a station cannot listen for collision while transmitting</li>
	<li>∴ the receiving station has to send an acknowledgement (ACK) to the sender if it detects no errors in the received frame</li>
	<li>If the sending station does not receive an ACK after a specified period of time, the sending station assumes a collision occured and retransmits the frame</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Drawback</strong> </p>

<ul>
	<li>High overheads, as every data required acknowledgement, and lower throughput</li>
</ul>

<h4>Request To Send (RTS) and Clear To Send (CTS)</h4>

<p>DCF incorporates the optional use of RTS / CTS protocol to reduce collisions further</p>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Sending client sends RTS frame to AP</li>
	<li>AP broadcasts RTS frame to receiving client, requesting for a certain amount of time to deliver data to it

		<ul>
			<li>RTS frame contains source, destination address and duration of transmission</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Receiving client responds with CTS frame when ready</li>
	<li>AP sends CTS frame to sending client</li>
	<li>AP alerts all client that the medium is now reserved and they should suspend transmissions</li>
	<li>Upon receiving CTS from AP, sending client begins transmission</li>
</ol>

<h3>Point Coordination Function (PCF)</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Optional</li>
	<li>Priority based</li>
	<li>Suitable for <strong>time-sensitive data</strong> such as audio &amp; video</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A point coordinator in AP controls the transmission of frames from all clients</li>
	<li>Each client is asked in sequence if it wants to transmit</li>
	<li>If client has nothing to transmit, it returns a null data frame</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Drawback</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>High overheads due to polling frames</li>
</ul>

<h2>802.11 MAC Frame Formats</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>IEEE 802.11 MAC frames are not the same as 802.3 Ethernet frames. They have different formats and functions. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Management Frames</h3>

<p>Sets up initial communication between client and AP (e.g. association request &amp; response)</p>

<h3>Control Frames</h3>

<p>Assists in delivering frames that contains data (e.g. RTS, CTS, ACK)</p>

<h3>Data Frames</h3>

<p>Carries info to be transmitted to client</p>

<h2>MAC layer operations</h2>

<p>MAC layer has 3 main roles</p>

<h3>Discovering the WLAN</h3>

<ul>
	<li>AP must transmit info about itself so clients can connect to it</li>
	<li>Discovery process is done by passive or active scanning</li>
</ul>

<h4>Passive Scanning</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The AP sends a beacon frame to announce its presence at regular interval</li>
	<li>Client listens for beacon frame containing AP’s SSID</li>
</ul>

<h4>Active Scanning</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Client sends out probe request frame and wait for probe response frame from AP(s)</li>
	<li>Probe request frame may contain SSID of desired AP </li>
</ul>

<h3>Joining the WLAN</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Client initiates the authentication and association steps of joining the network via the AP</li>
</ul>


<h4>Authentication</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The process in which the AP accepts a client</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AP requires client to be authenticated prior to joining the network</p>

<h5>Open System Authentication</h5>

<p>Basic and default method</p>

<ol>
	<li>Client sends authentication request frame to AP</li>
	<li>AP replies with authentication response frame (contains acceptance or rejection notice)</li>
</ol>

<h5>Shared Key Authentication</h5>

<p>AP and client given the same key in advance (Pre-Shared)</p>

<ol>
	<li>Client sends an authentication frame to AP</li>
	<li>AP responds with an authentication frame containing challenge text</li>
	<li>Client encrypts text with pre-shared key and responds</li>
	<li>AP verifies the encryption key used</li>
</ol>

<h4>Association</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Enables the client access to the WLAN</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
	<li>Client begins to negotiate a WLAN connection with AP</li>
	<li>To join WLAN, client sends <strong>association request frame</strong> to AP

		<ul>
			<li>Frame includes client’s own capabilities and supported data rates</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>If AP accepts the request, it will reply with an <strong>association response frame</strong>

		<ul>
			<li>Frame includes status code and client ID number (used while client is connected)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Client has joined WLAN and can begin communicating</li>
</ol>

<h4>Re-Association (ROAMING)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Allows a device in an area covered by an AP to move to another area covered by another AP to remain connected to the network (seamless roaming)</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
	<li>When client determines the link to its current AP is poor, it begins scanning for another AP</li>
	<li>It sends <strong>re-association request frame</strong> to new AP</li>
	<li>If new AP accepts request, it will reply with a <strong>re-association response frame</strong></li>
	<li>New AP also sends <strong>disassociation frame</strong> to old AP</li>
	<li>The disassociation frame terminates the old AP’s association with the client</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note: </strong> Re-Association only works in ESS wireless networks</p>
